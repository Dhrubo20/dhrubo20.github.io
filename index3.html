        <h1>To someone who just isn't sure when to get angry:</h1>

            Self-love exists more often as an illusion in our lives. And the easiest way we end up depriving ourselves of this is when we undermine our own emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process happens almost subconsciously honestly.. as if it were a mere reflex. You probably felt as if your were overreacting when your friend gave you an annoying nickname in a group chat. You despise it to this day, and the fact that everyone just keeps tagging you by that name is just the bigger piss-off isn't it? 
        </p>
        <p>
            But what has been your response? You have blamed yourself! For acting childish. For being hurt by a 'mere' nickname. Over and over again. You were driven crazy wondering why you couldnt take the joke. And you absolutely dismissed it as something even worthy to be bugged about..

        </p>
        <p>
            Quite unnecessarily so.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do not have to put up a fake smile and nod when your friends taunt you for that one time your squad had to cancel a movie plan because your mom said NO. Those people weren't there when you kept repeatedly nagging your mom to get that one affirmative answer out of her. They failed to see how miserable you had felt when you texted "You guys go ahead without me issokay". It wasn't okay for you then. And now.. when you get attacked for things out of your control, it isn't okay either. But you opt to cave yourself within the feeble walls of self-doubt. You decide to dump that voice screaming at the back of your head *I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE* under the rugged mattress of decency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The truth is.. it doesnt matter how trivial an issue 'seems'. Nothing is 'insignificant' if it makes you feel angry. If it drowns that beaming happiness on your face and masks it with a frown, it is important to be addressed, important to be talked about, and important to let out of you before you explode.

            I know why it's difficult for you to feel this way. Maybe you know friendship is more than just an everyday occurance for you. Because you literally have no clue how you became friends with the person who you spend the most hours of a day talking to right now! Or maybe because you want to keep aside all the issues because that one person means a lot to you. Your happiness has become increasingly more reliant on that person's presence in your life.

            Here's the word though, mate. If you need to mask your own emotions out of fear of losing someone, that is the biggest injustice you do to yourself. Besides, if someone fails to see the reason that made you lash out and feel horrible about an incident, it's about time that you re-evaluate that person's worth in your life. 

            Understand that human emotions and sentiments work very delicately... more importantly, very uniquely. What can be a joke to someone can definitely be something that offends you. But do not hold yourself accountable for not being able to flow with the tide. Do not thrust upon yourself a liability to make yourself feel how everyone else does. 

            There are no 'right' reasons to be angry. There are only personal ones.

            In those days where the sky was full of bright and luminous sparks, it was peaceful. The stars were the presentiment of one’s fate. The wind was a great esteem to all. The natural flow of the universe was their essence of life. Fireflies enchanted the land of black with their immortal gleam. The nights seemed sleepless, as the stars cast an infinite aura to rejuvenate our resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well now that I close my eyes, I find myself lucky to be in those days_when I was a boy. The nights bewitched me. It kept me awake for as long as the stars kept twinkling. The magnanimity of nature made my soul shrill out of my vessel and dissolve into the eternal winds.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the morning the sun shone brilliantly and made a net of warm atmosphere. The warmth was not all a burning kind, but a gentle and calm one. It was our inspiration for a better tomorrow. The nature was a mine for a new age. But now that I open my eyes and see the present ,which we called ‘a better tomorrow’ back in those days, is nothing but a vague truth, which is a beauty of lies to us.

           In the darkest evening of the year the morning star shines the brightest. Like a kindle of fire it is about to burn out, but the most magnanimous air rejuvenates it. So once again it shines to wake the reign of sleepless nights. The stars rule the sky of tomorrow. Our world is a veiled mirror of the future we dream. Aiming high might someday lead us to a land beyond our wildest imaginations. So for that to happen we must never lose sight of what we seek. Every power that surpasses logic comes from logic. Every logic we believe is the truth comes from ideas. If the ideas are sustainable in the present time then those ideas become the truth. So what exactly is the truth? The truth is nothing and everything at the same time. There is no fixed truth. We all chase the stars of phantasmic nights. Forever, staying awake. We try to fly beyond the stars, thinking that we might find our truth there. But truly the truth is always with us. It is almost like we are the embodiment of truth. It’s just that we cannot sense it. The stars are there only to manifest into our hopes. However, the stars are not what we need to chase. We Just need to hear the call of the truth from within our own souls and then we will be at peace.
